 * Woah? What's this? 🤔 It's a weird looking comment. Another *, eh?
 * Write a little bit about yourself here. What's your name? Where are you from? What do you do?
 *  

 * My name is Hannah. I love listening to KPOP or Korean RNB music. If it's not in these two dramas, it either is featured in Supernatural or on TikTok.
 I'm a college student studying CS at Pitt.
 * I'm a comment, and I want to say hi! 👋
